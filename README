This is a start up script for minecraft_server.jar server.

Let's say you want to host your own minecraft server on an Ubuntu box, well it
sucks to log in and start/stop the server manually.  On top of that you have to
run the thing in a terminal multiplexer like gnu screen or tmux for it to keep
running after you log out of the server.

This script attempts to do all that for you and as gracefully as it can manage.
It starts the minecraft_server.jar in a tmux/screen session & then when the
server is told to stop it sends the Minecraft server 'stop' command to the
associated tmux/screen session.

Basically you place this script into your /etc/init.d/ folder in Ubuntu, then
modify the script to change the $MINECRAFT_USER & $MINE_PATH variables to what
you desire (Warning! Do not use root as the $MINECRAFT_USER as this would be
dangerous to your Ubuntu machine's security).

Remember to chown your $MINE_PATH folder to the user you choose, e.g.,
$ sudo chown -R bob. /world9 # where $MINECRAFT_USER is bob and $MINE_PATH is
/world9.

Make sure to place the minecraft_server.jar file into your $MINE_PATH as this
is where the script assumes it to be.

Usage:

minecraft [start|stop|status|restart]

start   Starts the minecraft server in a tmux/screen session.
stop    Sends the minecraft 'stop' command to the tmux/screen session.
status  Prints out whether minecraft server is running and how to connect to the
	associated tmux/screen session.
restart Basically runs the stop function & then the start function.

Once you have set the required variables... To get this script to run
automatically on start up and stop gracefully at reboot/halt do the following:

$ sudo update-rc.d minecraft defaults

Remember!  To administrate your Minecraft server you will need to find out how
to connect to it's associated tmux/screen session, to do that run:

$ sudo /etc/init.d/minecraft status
Minecraft appears to be running...

*tmux session info: 0: 1 windows (created Thu Feb  9 20:19:35 2012) [80x23]
*To connect to the tmux(1) session and administrate the minecraft server, do the
following: sudo -u nobody tmux a -t 0
*When finished, detach from the session with the following keystrokes: Ctrl-b d.



If you noticed the status command prints out how to connect to the minecraft
server session:

'sudo -u nobody tmux a -t 0'
